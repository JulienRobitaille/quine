## Shadow Mapping

* [Shadow Mapping for Hemispherical and Omnidirectional Light Sources](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.11.3540&rep=rep1&type=pdf) by Brabec, Annen, and Seidel covers (dual) parabolic shadow mapping, which would let us get away with a single shadow map per hemisphere, especially if we didn't have any of those pesky triangles. Hrmm. =)

## Reflections

* [The Future of Screenspace Reflections](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/BartlomiejWronski/20140129/209609/The_future_of_screenspace_reflections.php) by Bartlomiej Wronski talks about some of the issues with using screen space approaches for reflections. However, it is interesting that at least in screenspace the reflections can reflect specular highlights.
